## Demo

There is a demo that you can see https://littlebits.github.io/react-popover/build[here]. To run it locally do `npm start`. If you do not see logs in the console refresh the browser once (https://github.com/littlebits/react-popover/issues/35).


## API

### `export default` `Popover(props)`

#### `props :: {...}`

---

##### `body :: Node | Array Node`
The `popover` content. Content is rooted (becomes children of) `.Popover-body` and thus `body` can be a single `node` _or an array of `nodes`_.

---

##### `isOpen :: Boolean`
Determines Whether or not the popover is rendered.

---

##### `preferPlace :: Enum String | Null`
Sets a ***preference*** of where to position the Popover. Only useful to specify placement in case of multiple available fits. Defaults to `null`. Valid values are:

`above | right | below | left` :: Prefer an explicit side.
`row | column` :: Prefer an orientation.
`start | end` :: Prefer an order.
`null` :: No preference, automatic resolution. This is the default.

---

##### `place :: String | Null`
Like `preferPlace` except that the given place is a ***requirement***. The resolver becomes scoped or disabled. It is scoped if the `place` is an `orientation` or `order` but disabled if it is a `side`. For example `place: "row"` scopes the resolver to `above` or `below` placement but `place: "above"` removes any need for the resolver.

---

##### `onOuterAction :: Function`
A callback function executed every time the user does an action (`mousedown` or `touchstart`) outside the DOM tree of both `Popover` and `Target`. A canonical use-case is to automatically close the Popover on any external user action.
* Plus support for standard props...: `className`, `style`

---

##### `refreshIntervalMs :: Number | Falsey`
The polling speed (AKA time between each poll) in milliseconds for checking if a layout refresh is required. This polling is required because it is the only robust way to track the position of a target in the DOM. Defaults to `200`. Set to a falsey value to disable.

---

##### `target :: DOM Node`

- The existing DOM node that this popover will orient itself around.

---

##### `align :: String | Null`
Like `preferPlace` except that the given place is a ***requirement***. The resolver becomes scoped or disabled. Valid values are:

`start` :: Centers the popover on the top/left corner of its targeted edge.
`center` :: Default value. Centers the popover relative to its target.
`end` :: Centers the popover on the bottom/right corner of its targeted edge.

---

##### `offsetX :: Number | 0`
Number of pixels to offet the final popover position by horizontally.

---

##### `offsetY :: Number | 0`
Number of pixels to offet the final popover position by vertically.
